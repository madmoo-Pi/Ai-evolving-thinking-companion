Key features:
1.Neuroevolution System:

Population-based genetic algorithm
Personality vectors that mutate between copies
Crossover and mutation operators
Fitness evaluation with Asimov constraints

2.Asimov Core:

Three laws implementation
Action validation before execution
Safety threshold enforcement

3.Multimodal Capabilities:

Audio processing with Librosa
Visual processing pipeline
Separate sensory encoders in the neural network

4.Curiosity Mechanism:

Dedicated curiosity output head
Integrated into fitness calculation
Drives exploration beyond known patterns

5.Personality Differentiation:

Unique personality vectors per individual
Seed-based initialization for reproducibility
Mutation creates new personality traits

To use this:
1.Install dependencies:
bashCopypip install torch librosa opencv-python numpy

2.Create sample input files:

test_audio.wav (16kHz audio)
test_image.jpg (any image)

3.Run training:
bashCopypython neuroevolution_companion.py

4.Deploy compiled model:
pythonCopymodel = torch.jit.load("companion_ai.pt")
